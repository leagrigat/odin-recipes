    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../images/pizza.jpg" alt="A juicy cheesy pizza"> 

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pizza uses the usual red sauce—a unique and healthy pizza for those bored with the traditional. Top with your favorite veggies and cheese.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 Basil, large fresh</li>
        <li>2 Garlic cloves, fresh</li>
        <li>1 cup San marzano tomatoes, canned</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 cups All-purpose flour, unbleached</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Black pepper, freshly ground</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp Diamond crystal kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp Granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare Pizza Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry, but don’t worry.</li>
    <li>Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. It should quickly come together and begin to get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on humidity levels) – it should be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top.  After about 3 minutes, the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl.</li>
    <li>Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. Proofing Tip: If your kitchen is very cold, heat a large heatproof measuring cup of water in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm environment. Remove the cup and place the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has risen.</li>
    <li>Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone: Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven (roughly 8 inches from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and steel (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for a minumum of 1 hour. If your oven does not go up to 550°F (285°C) or you are using a delicate pizza stone, I recommend heating it to a maximum of 500°F (260°C).</li>
  </ol>
